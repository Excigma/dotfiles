bspwm, 

Most of my sxhkd hotkeys are from [bspwm's example `sxhkdrc`](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm/blob/0.9.10/examples/sxhkdrc), and [@advilm's dotfiles](https://github.com/advilm/dotfiles)

Colors based off One Dark theme, taken from [@AbdelrhmanNile's dotfiles](https://github.com/AbdelrhmanNile/mydots_bspwm), which in turn uses some of [@Siduck's dotfiles](https://github.com/siduck/chadwm), including [@Siduck's GTK theme](https://github.com/siduck/dotfiles/tree/master/gtk/siduck-onedark)

Polybar configuration taken off [@diced's dotfiles](https://github.com/diced/dotfiles), [@advilm's dotfiles](https://github.com/diced/dotfiles), and [@Z-8Bit's dotfiles](https://github.com/Z-8Bit/Bspwm)

Uses a modified version of [polywins](https://github.com/tam-carre/polywins) to show only when monocle mode is on

Uses a modified version of [polybar-spotify](https://github.com/PrayagS/polybar-spotify) that doesn't scroll (it's a bit distracting for me)

Rofi configuration completely ripped off from [@advilm's dotfiles](https://github.com/diced/dotfiles) with minor edits thanks to [@Z-8Bit](https://github.com/Z-8Bit)

Alacritty configuration completely ripped off from [@Z-8Bit's dotfiles](https://github.com/Z-8Bit) with minor edits

[`scripts/brightness.sh`](https://github.com/Excigma/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/brightness.sh) and [`scripts/volume.sh`](https://github.com/Excigma/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/volume.sh) are budget versions of [@diced's](https://github.com/diced) volume fader in [his dotfiles](https://github.com/diced/dotfiles)
