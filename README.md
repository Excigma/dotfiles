# My dotfiles

### Heavily opinionated set of dotfiles that I use, aggregated from other peoples' dotfiles

Nowadays, I just run a moderately default KDE Plasma desktop with the taskbar moved to the side for a little more screen space.
The reason I don't commit or push my KDE Plasma configs is because when resetting, I typically to want to start fresh.
It doesn't take that long to set everything up through the GUIs anyway.
My dotfiles are getting increasingly boring.
